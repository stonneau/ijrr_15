We address the issue of automatically planning discrete sequences of contacts
that characterize a multiped motion in a constraining environment.
To overcome the inherent combinatorial difficulty of this problem, we separate it
in two sub-problems: first, planning a guide path for the root of the robot and
then, generating contacts along this path.
We propose theoretical contributions for each sub-problem, and implement them
as a complete contact planner. 
First, we generate a guide root path without explicitly computing configurations in static equilibrium, as opposed to previous approaches.
To do this we propose to approximate the space of equilibrium configurations using the ``reachability condition".
Verifying this condition boils down to performing simple collision tests and, in the considered environments, this approximation turns out to be accurate.
Then, we propose an algorithm to extend a root guide path into a sequence of equilibrium configurations.
A sampling-based approach is used to generate candidate contacts.
The best candidate is chosen according to user-defined heuristics. We propose four such heuristics, used in all our experiments, and 
designed for generic robotic applications.
These contributions are implemented within the open-source software Hpp. Our framework allows us to generate complex multi-contact sequences in at most a few seconds for a large variety of robots, including HRP-2, HyQ, and a dexterous hand.
