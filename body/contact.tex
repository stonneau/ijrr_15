\section{From a guide path to a discrete sequence of contact configurations ($\mathcal{P}_2$)}
\label{sec:contact}
Our planner computes guide paths in \gls{creach0}, an over-approximation of the set of \gls{equilibrium feasible} paths, \gls{ccequil0}.
As an input of this stage, we however assume an \gls{equilibrium feasible} guide path $\mathbf{q}^0(t) : [0,1] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^r$ for the root of the robot $R$.
If this is not the case, our planner will fail rapidly, thus allowing replanning, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:perf}.
We now consider the second problem of computing a discrete sequence of contact configurations $\mathbf{Q}^{\overline{0}}$ for the limbs of the robot along $\mathbf{q}^0(t)$.

In this Section we first describe a single contact-generation process, that is how to generate a contact configuration for a given limb 
and root location.
Then, we propose an iterative algorithm to generate a discrete sequence of contact configurations in static equilibrium.

Our criterion to assert efficiently the static equilibrium of the system
is described in Section~\ref{sec:heuristics}.

\subsection{Definition of a contact generator}
\label{sec:single_contact}
We consider a limb $R^k$  and a root configuration $\mathbf{q}^0$.
From \glslink{contact feasible}{\textit{contact feasibility}} we know that there exists at least one $\mathbf{q}^{\overline{0}}$ that verifies $\mathbf{q}^k \oplus \mathbf{q}^{\overline{k}} \in$ \gls{ccontact}.
The issue is then to exhibit locally this $\mathbf{q}^{\overline{0}}$.

While exhibiting analytically a $\mathbf{q}^{\overline{0}}$ does not seem tractable, we can iteratively try to generate one as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate randomly a collision-free limb configuration;
\item Project the end-effector onto the closest surface with inverse kinematics;
\item If a valid solution is found, stop. Otherwise repeat from step 1.
\end{enumerate}


We partially trade the completeness property of this approach for a more efficient solution introduced in our previous work~\citep{Tonneau2014}, which we describe
here for completeness.

We first define $C_{Contact}^{\epsilon} \supset C_{Contact}$ as the set of configurations almost in contact. This means that the minimal distance 
between an effector and a surface of the environment is less than a small value $\epsilon$.
We then apply the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate off-line $N$ valid sample limb configurations $\mathbf{q}^k_i,  0 \leq i < N$;
\item Using the end-effector positions $\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{q}^k_i)$ as indices, store each sample in an octree data structure;
\item At runtime, when contact creation is required, retrieve from the octree the list of samples $S \subset C_{Contact}^{\epsilon}$ close to contact (Figure~\ref{fig:contact_gen} (b) and (c));
\item According to a user-defined heuristic $h$, sort the elements of $S$;
\item Select the first configuration of $S$. Project the configuration onto contact with inverse kinematics. If $S$ is empty, stop (failure case) (Figure~\ref{fig:contact_gen} (d) and (e));
\item If a valid solution is found, stop (success case). Otherwise remove the element from $S$ and go back step 5.
\end{enumerate}

This approach has two main advantages.
First, this allows us to select a large number of candidates in a single proximity request.
Having several candidates is interesting, because it allows to compare them using a user-selected heuristic $h$, thus obtaining
a locally-optimal candidate.
Furthermore, the fact that the candidates are already close to contact increases the odds that the inverse kinematics will converge to a valid solution in a small number of iterations.
Regarding convergence, it is immediate to verify that as $N$ grows, the probability of finding a solution if it exists converges to 1.
$N$ is a parameter that allows us to specify the trade-off between exhaustiveness and efficiency.
The reader is invited to refer to our previous work for an extensive discussion on the optimal value of $N$ \citep{Tonneau2014}.

It should be noted that a failure case for our contact generator does not necessarily mean that the planner will globally fail. Indeed,
for a given root configuration, if contact configurations are found for other limbs, resulting in static equilibrium, the configuration will be accepted despite
the failure to generate a contact.

We thus have defined a real-time contact generator. For a given configuration, the generator can be as complete as required by the context (by increasing the number of samples).

\subsection{Extension of the guide path}
Using the contact generator, we define an iterative algorithm to generate the contact
sequence along the guide path.
Although we address acyclic contact sequences, the algorithm is deterministic in the order in which 
the contacts are created, allowing it to break the combinatorial.
The complete algorithm can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:contact}.
In the remainder of the section we provide an intuition of it.

As an input, we consider the guide path $\mathbf{q}^0(t)$, automatically discretized into a sequence of $j$ key configurations:  
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbf{Q}^0 = [\mathbf{q}^0_{0}; \mathbf{q}^0_{i}; ..., \mathbf{q}^0_{j-1}]
\end{equation*} 
where $\mathbf{q}^0_{0}$ and $\mathbf{q}^0_{j-1}$ respectively correspond to the start and goal configurations. To ensure continuity in the contact transition phases, we propose a recursive mapping $\pi$, for any $0<i<j$:
\begin{equation*}
    \pi\colon\left\{
    \begin{aligned}		
        \mathbf{Q}^0 \in C_{equil}^0 & \longrightarrow C_{equil} \\
        %\mathbf{q}^{0}_0 &  \longrightarrow  \mathbf{q}_{start} \\
        \mathbf{q}^{0}_i &  \longrightarrow  \mathbf{q}^{0}_i \oplus g(\mathbf{q}_{i - 1},\mathbf{q}^{0}_i) 
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation*} 
$g$ is the method that extends a root configuration into a full-body configuration. At each step, it tries to generate a contact configuration that preserves as much as possible
the previous contacts while allowing for static equilibrium. The objective is thus to characterize $g$.
We initialize the recurrence with $\pi(\mathbf{q}^0_{0}) = \mathbf{q}_0$ the initial configuration of the robot.

%~ The function $g$ is defined independently by $g^k$ for each limb $R^k$. In defining $g^k$, two aspects must be considered. Is the limb $R^k$ in contact? And which criteria is it optimizing? 

\subsubsection{Maintaining a contact in the sequence.}

Figure~\ref{fig:break_contact} illustrates the contact-persistence strategy.
If possible, a limb in contact at time $i-1$ remains in contact at time $i$. The contact is broken if an inverse-kinematics solver fails to find a collision-free limb configuration that satisfies joint limits. The solver is directly provided by the HPP software.

If the solver fails, the contact is broken and a collision-free configuration is assigned to the limb.
If two or more contacts are broken in a single time step, intermediate steps are added to reposition the contacts one at a time, before moving.

%\subsection{Generation of a contact configuration}  
\subsection{Creating contacts.}
Contacts are created using three rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Only one contact creation can happen between two consecutive states. This increases the odds that the interpolation between the two states be feasible;
%\adnote{Before you said that you ensured that transition between two states is feasible...}
\item A contact is validated if and only if the resulting configuration is in static equilibrium, no matter what user-defined heuristics are used; 
\item We use a FIFO approach:  we always try first to create a contact with the limb that has been contact-free the longest. If the contact creation
was not successful for a limb, the limb is pushed on top of the queue, and will only be tried again after the others have been treated.
\end{enumerate}

These three rules provide a deterministic manner to generate contacts along the discretized guide path.
For a given \gls{equilibrium feasible} path, our current implementation does not guarantee that the planner will succeed in generating a configuration in static equilibrium, because
of the deterministic approach used to break the combinatorial.
However, in practice the planner is successful in the large majority of cases, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:perf}, thanks to 
the heuristics that we use for contact selection.
