\section{Heuristics for relevant contact selection}

\subsection{A heuristic for robust quasi static balance}
The planner is designed so that any contact configuration it outputs is quasi statically balanced.
Balance is of course critical in multipedal locomotion. For this reason we are interested in a robust 
criterion, that ensures that the robot remains balanced in a real world application, regardless of the errors
that can result from peception and control uncertainties.

We first give a classic linear program (LP) that asserts that a contact configuration is statically balanced.
From this formulation we derive a new LP that returns a quantification of the robustness of the configuration regarding balance.
From this value we can in turn either define a heuristic to choose the more robust candidate, or set a treshold on the required balance robustness
for any configuration. While the LP we propose is new, it is based on an analysis of the problem we propose in \cite{Prete2016}, where the interested reader
can find more details.


\subsubsection{Conditions for static balance.}
We first define the variables of the problem, for a robot $R$ and $e$ contact points, expressed in world coordinates:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the robot center of mass (COM);
\item $\mathbf{L}  \in \mathbb{R}^3 $ is the angular momentum at the COM;
\item $\mathbf{m} \in \mathbb{R}$ is the robot mass;
\item $\mathbf{g} = [0,0,-9.81]^T$ is the gravity acceleration;
\item $\mu$ is the friction coefficient;
\item for the i-th contact $1 \leq i \leq e$:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathbf{p_i}$ is the contact position;
	\item $\mathbf{f_i}$ is the force applied at $\mathbf{p_i}$;
	\item $\mathbf{n}_i,\mathbf{t}_{i1},\mathbf{t}_{i2}$ form a local cartesian coordinate system centered at $\mathbf{p_i}$. $\mathbf{n}_i$ is aligned
	with the contact surface normal, and the $\mathbf{t}_i$s are tangent vectors.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

According to Coulomb's law, the robot is statically balanced if all contact forces lie in the friction cone defined by the surface.
As classically done, we linearize the friction cone in a conservative fashion with a pyramid, described by four generating rays. We choose for instance:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{V}_{i} = \mat{\mathbf{n}_{i} + \mu \mathbf{t}_{i1} & \mathbf{n}_{i} -\mu \mathbf{t}_{i1} & \mathbf{n}_{i} + \mu \mathbf{t}_{i2} & \mathbf{n}_{i} - \mu \mathbf{t}_{i2}}^T
\end{equation*}

Any force belonging to the linearized cone
can thus be express as a linear combination of its four generating rays.
Therefore a constraint on the $\mathbf{f}_i$ is given by the relation:

\begin{equation*}
\forall i  \qquad  \exists \bm{\beta}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{+4} , \mathbf{f}_{i} = \mathbf{V}_{i} \bm{\beta}_i \qquad 
\end{equation*}

we can stack the constraints to obtain:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gen}
\exists \bm{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^{+4e} , \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{V} \bm{\beta} \qquad 
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{V} = \diag{ \{\mathbf{V}_1, \dots, \mathbf{V}_e\} }$, and $\mathbf{f} = [\mathbf{f}_0,...,\mathbf{f}_e]^T$.

Additional constraints on the forces result from Newton-Euler equations:

\begin{align}
\underbrace{\mat{m (\ddot{\mathbf{c}} - \mathbf{g})  \\ m \mathbf{c} \times (\ddot{\mathbf{c}} - \mathbf{g}) + \dot{\mathbf{L}}}}_\mathbf{w}
= 
\underbrace{
\mat{\mathbf{I}_3 & \dots & \mathbf{I}_3 \\
\hat{\mathbf{p}}_1 & \dots & \hat{\mathbf{p}}_e} \mathbf{V}
}_\mathbf{G}
\bm{\beta},
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{w}\in \Rv{6}$ is the so-called gravito-inertial wrench (GIW) \citep{qiu:dhm:2011, Caron2015} and $\hat{\mathbf{p}} \in \R{3}{3}$ is the cross-product matrix associated to $\mathbf{p}$.

Static balance assumes zero acceleration thus we can write:
\begin{align} \label{eq:new_eul}
\mathbf{w}_0 = 
\underbrace{\mat{\mathbf{0}_{3\times 3} \\ m \hat{\mathbf{g}}}}_{\mathbf{D}} \mathbf{c} + 
\underbrace{\mat{-m\mathbf{g} \\ \mathbf{0}}}_{\mathbf{d}}
\end{align}
The wrench $\mathbf{w}_0$ is independent of $c^z$ because of the cross product matrix $\hat{\mathbf{g}}$ inside $\mathbf{D}$, so we can rewrite \eqref{eq:new_eul} as:
\begin{align} \label{eq:new_eul2d}
\mathbf{w}_0 = \mathbf{D}^{xy} \mathbf{c}^{xy} + \mathbf{d}
\end{align}

If there exists a $\bm{\beta}^*$ satisfying equations \ref{eq:gen} and \ref{eq:new_eul2d}, it means that the configuration is statically balanced.
The problem can then be formulated as an LP:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:lin_prog} \begin{aligned}
\find \quad & \bm{\beta} \in \Rv{+4e} \\
\st \quad &\mathbf{G} \bm{\beta} = \mathbf{D}^{xy} \mathbf{c}^{xy} + \mathbf{d} \\
& \bm{\beta} \ge 0 \\
\end{aligned} \end{equation}

\subsubsection{Formulation of a robust LP:}
Let $b_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ a scalar value. We now define the following LP:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:lin_prog_rob} \begin{aligned}
\find \quad & \bm{\beta} \in \Rv{+4e}, b_0 \in \Rv{} \\
\minimize  \quad & -b_0 \\
\st \quad &\mathbf{G} \bm{\beta} = \mathbf{D}^{xy} \mathbf{c}^{xy} + \mathbf{d} \\
& \bm{\beta} \ge b_0 \\
\end{aligned} \end{equation}

We observe that if $b_0$ is positive, LP~\ref{eq:lin_prog} admits a solution. The higher $b_0$, the further away from the cone limits admissible forces can be found. If $b_0$ is negative, the configuration is not balanced, and the value $b_0$ indicates "how far" from static balance
the configuration is. $b_0$ can thus be seen as a measure of robustness.

In our implementation, we solve the dual of LP~\ref{eq:lin_prog_rob}.
after a trivial elimination of Lagrange multipliers the dual problem has lower dimensionality:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dual} \begin{aligned}
\find \quad & \bm{\nu} \in \Rv{6}\\
\minimize  \quad & (\mathbf{D}^{xy} \mathbf{c}^{xy} + \mathbf{d})^T \nu \\
\st \quad &\mathbf{G}^T \bm{\nu} \ge 0 \\
& \mathbf{1}^T \mathbf{G}^T \bm{\nu} = 1 \\
\end{aligned} \end{equation}

Indeed, from Slater's condition, we know that the optimal values of a LP and its dual are equal. Thus the optimal value of LP~\ref{eq:dual} is indeed the optimal $b_0$.

In conclusion, LP~\ref{eq:dual} provides a method to assert rapidly quasi static balance, and returns a robustness value, that can be used as a heuristic for robust static balance.
Another option to enforce robustness is to set a minimum acceptable value for $b_0$; this avoids ponderating balance robustness with other heuristics,
but as a result this conservative approach is not complete.
