\section{Heuristics for relevant contact selection}

\subsection{A heuristic for robust static equilibrium}
The planner is designed so that any generated contact configuration is in static equilibrium.
Equilibrium is of course critical in multipedal locomotion. For this reason we are interested in a robust 
criterion, that ensures that the robot remains balanced in a real-world application, regardless of perception and control uncertainties.

We first give a linear program (LP) that asserts that a contact configuration is in static equilibrium.
From this formulation we derive a new LP that quantifies the robustness of the configuration regarding equilibrium.
In turn, from this value we can either define a heuristic to choose the most robust candidate, or set a threshold on the required robustness\deleted{for any configuration}. While the presented LP is original, it is based on an analysis of the problem that we proposed in \cite{Prete2016}, where the interested reader can find more details.


\subsubsection{Conditions for static balance.}
We first define the variables of the problem, for a robot $R$ and $e$ contact points, expressed in world coordinates:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the robot center of mass (COM);
\item $\mathbf{L}  \in \mathbb{R}^3 $ is the angular momentum at the COM;
\item $\mathbf{m} \in \mathbb{R}$ is the robot mass;
\item $\mathbf{g} = [0,0,-9.81]^T$ is the gravity acceleration;
\item $\mu$ is the friction coefficient;
\item for the i-th contact point $1 \leq i \leq e$:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathbf{p_i}$ is the contact position;
	\item $\mathbf{f_i}$ is the force applied at $\mathbf{p_i}$;
	\item $\mathbf{n}_i,\mathbf{t}_{i1},\mathbf{t}_{i2}$ form a local cartesian coordinate system centered at $\mathbf{p_i}$. $\mathbf{n}_i$ is aligned
	with the contact surface normal, and the $\mathbf{t}_i$s are tangent vectors.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

According to Coulomb's law, \replaced{slipping occurs only if a contact force is on the boundaries of the friction cone.}{ the non slipping condition is verified if all the contact forces lie in the friction cone defined by the surface.}
As classically done, we linearize the friction cone in a conservative fashion with a pyramid, described by four generating rays. We choose for instance:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{V}_{i} = \mat{\mathbf{n}_{i} + \mu \mathbf{t}_{i1} & \mathbf{n}_{i} -\mu \mathbf{t}_{i1} & \mathbf{n}_{i} + \mu \mathbf{t}_{i2} & \mathbf{n}_{i} - \mu \mathbf{t}_{i2}}^T
\end{equation*}

Any force belonging to the linearized cone
can thus be expressed as a convex combination of its four generating rays.
\deleted{Therefore we can express the nonslipping constraint on $\mathbf{f}_i$ as:}

\begin{equation*}
\forall i  \qquad  \exists \bm{\beta}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{4} : \bm{\beta}_i \ge 0 \wedge \mathbf{f}_{i} = \mathbf{V}_{i} \bm{\beta}_i,
\end{equation*}
\added{where $\bm{\beta}_i$ contains the coefficient of the cone generators.}
We can then stack all the constraints to obtain:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gen}
\exists \bm{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^{4e} ,  \bm{\beta} \ge 0 \wedge \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{V} \bm{\beta},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{V} = \diag{ \{\mathbf{V}_1, \dots, \mathbf{V}_e\} }$, and $\mathbf{f} = (\mathbf{f}_0,...,\mathbf{f}_e)$.

From the Newton-Euler equations, and assuming a null acceleration of the COM, we want the contact forces to compensate the gravity at the center of mass:


%~ \begin{align}
%~ \underbrace{\mat{m (\ddot{\mathbf{c}} - \mathbf{g})  \\ m \mathbf{c} \times (\ddot{\mathbf{c}} - \mathbf{g}) + \dot{\mathbf{L}}}}_\mathbf{w}
%~ = 
%~ \underbrace{
%~ \mat{\mathbf{I}_3 & \dots & \mathbf{I}_3 \\
%~ \hat{\mathbf{p}}_1 & \dots & \hat{\mathbf{p}}_e} \mathbf{V}
%~ }_\mathbf{G}
%~ \bm{\beta},
%~ \end{align}
%~ where $\mathbf{w}\in \Rv{6}$ is the so-called gravito-inertial wrench (GIW) \citep{qiu:dhm:2011, Caron2015} and $\hat{\mathbf{p}} \in \R{3}{3}$ is the cross-product matrix associated to $\mathbf{p}$.

%~ Static balance assumes zero acceleration thus we can write:
\begin{align} \label{eq:new_eul}
\underbrace{
\mat{\mathbf{I}_3 & \dots & \mathbf{I}_3 \\
\hat{\mathbf{p}}_1 & \dots & \hat{\mathbf{p}}_e} \mathbf{V}
}_\mathbf{G} \bm{\beta}, = 
\underbrace{\mat{\mathbf{0}_{3\times 3} \\ m \hat{\mathbf{g}}}}_{\mathbf{D}} \mathbf{c} + 
\underbrace{\mat{-m\mathbf{g} \\ \mathbf{0}}}_{\mathbf{d}}
\end{align}
where $\hat{\mathbf{x}} \in \R{3}{3}$ is the cross-product matrix associated to $\mathbf{x}$.
The right hand side of \eqref{eq:new_eul} is independent of $\mathbf{c}^z$ because of the cross product matrix $\hat{\mathbf{g}}$ inside $\mathbf{D}$, so we can rewrite it as: \adnote{It is not really necessary to show that equilibrium is independent of the com altitude here, anyway the com is given, not a variable, so it does not change the size of the problem}
\begin{align} \label{eq:new_eul2d}
\mathbf{w}_0 = \mathbf{D}^{xy} \mathbf{c}^{xy} + \mathbf{d}
\end{align}

If there exists a $\bm{\beta}^*$ satisfying \eqref{eq:gen} and \eqref{eq:new_eul2d}, it means that the configuration is statically balanced.
The problem can then be formulated as an LP:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:lin_prog} \begin{aligned}
\find \quad & \bm{\beta} \in \Rv{4e} \\
\st \quad &\mathbf{G} \bm{\beta} = \mathbf{D}^{xy} \mathbf{c}^{xy} + \mathbf{d} \\
& \bm{\beta} \ge 0 \\
\end{aligned} \end{equation}

\subsubsection{Formulation of a robust LP:}
Let $b_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ be a scalar value. We now define the following LP:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:lin_prog_rob} \begin{aligned}
\find \quad & \bm{\beta} \in \Rv{4e}, b_0 \in \Rv{} \\
\minimize  \quad & -b_0 \\
\st \quad &\mathbf{G} \bm{\beta} = \mathbf{D}^{xy} \mathbf{c}^{xy} + \mathbf{d} \\
& \bm{\beta} \ge b_0 \bm{1}\\
\end{aligned} \end{equation}

We observe that if $b_0$ is positive then \eqref{eq:lin_prog} admits a solution, and $b_0$ is proportional to the minimum distance of the equilibrium contact forces to the boundaries of the friction cones.
If $b_0$ is negative, the configuration is not in static equilibrium, and $b_0$ indicates ``how far'' from equilibrium the configuration is. We thus use $b_0$ as a measure of robustness.

In our implementation, rather than solving directly \eqref{eq:lin_prog_rob}, we solve an equivalent problem of smaller dimension that we get by taking the dual of \eqref{eq:lin_prog_rob} and eliminating the Lagrange multipliers associated to the inequality constraints:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dual} \begin{aligned}
\find \quad & \bm{\nu} \in \Rv{6}\\
\maximize  \quad & -(\mathbf{D}^{xy} \mathbf{c}^{xy} + \mathbf{d})^T \nu \\
\st \quad &\mathbf{G}^T \bm{\nu} \ge 0 \\
& \mathbf{1}^T \mathbf{G}^T \bm{\nu} = 1 \\
\end{aligned} \end{equation}

Indeed, from Slater's conditions \citep{Boyd:2004:CO:993483}, we know that the optimal values of an LP and its dual are equal. Thus the optimal value of the LP~\eqref{eq:dual} is indeed the optimal $b_0$.

In conclusion, the LP~\eqref{eq:dual} provides a method to assert rapidly static equilibrium, and returns a robustness value.
This robustness criterion can be immediately transformed into a heuristic, and eventually be ponderated with others.
Another option to enforce robustness is to set a minimum acceptable value for $b_0$, but as a result this conservative approach is not complete.
