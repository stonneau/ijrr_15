First of all, I would like to thank the authors for the significant
improvements to the paper. The contributions are much clearer, the
algorithms are better described, and I believe that my initial concerns
about the paper have been addressed. In particular, I would like to
thank the authors for the detailed inline responses.

I only have two minor points that I would suggest the authors address
in the final draft:

1) quote: * Also in Sect. I.A, the authors state that
”optimization-based approaches
only converge locally”. This is not necessarily true, as convex or
mixed-integer
convex optimizations can (sometimes) be solved to a verifiable global
optimum.
I would suggest removing this sentence entirely.
answer: Thanks for the suggestion. Our phrasing was indeed misleading
and inaccurate. Our
intention was to explain that the geometry of the scene makes the
problem highly non-convex,
and that approaches such as the CIO, if not initialized with an
appropriate initial guess, might
never get out of the local minima. We followed the Reviewer’s advice
and simply removed
the sentence.

response: It looks like that sentence was not actually removed from the
paper.

2) The dual reformulation of the LP in (11) in Sect. VI is fine, but is
a perfectly standard procedure (that, in fact, many LP solvers will
perform internally automatically). It would be sufficient to mention
that the dual problem is solved without giving its full formulation.
Whether the authors include the formulation is up to them.
