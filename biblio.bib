The motion of such virtual humans should look realistic (or ?natural?) and allow interaction with the surroundings and other (virtual) humans. Current animation techniques differ in the trade-off they offer between motion naturalness and the control that can be exerted over the motion. We show mechanisms to parametrize, combine (on different body parts) and concatenate motions generated by different animation techniques. We discuss several aspects of motion naturalness and show how it can be evaluated. We conclude by showing the promise of combinations of different animation paradigms to enhance both naturalness and control.}

                 performed in the framework of the Enactive project (EU
                 IST NoE Enactive). The aim of this research is to improve
                 believability of a virtual character using qualitative
                 analysis of gesture. Using techniques developed for human
                 gesture analysis, we show it is possible to extract
                 high-level motion features from reconstructed motion and
                 to compare them with the same features extracted from the
                 corresponding real motions. Moreover this method allows
                 us to evaluate whether the virtual character conveys the
                 same high level expressive content as the real motion
                 does, and makes it possible to compare different
                 rendering techniques in order to assess which one better
                 maintains such information.},

	abstract = {We present a novel optimization-based algorithm for motion planning in dynamic environments. Our approach uses a stochastic trajectory optimization framework to avoid collisions and satisfy smoothness and dynamics constraints. Our algorithm does not require a priori knowledge about global motion or trajectories of dynamic obstacles. Rather, we compute a conservative local bound on the position or trajectory of each obstacle over a short time and use the bound to compute a collision-free trajectory for the robot in an incremental manner. Moreover, we interleave planning and execution of the robot in an adaptive manner to balance between the planning horizon and responsiveness to obstacle. We highlight the performance of our planner in a simulated dynamic environment with the 7-DOF PR2 robot arm and dynamic obstacles.},

The main idea is to blend similar motion examples according to blending weights, in order to synthesize new motions parameterizing high level characteristics of interest. We present in this paper an in-depth analysis and comparison of four motion blending techniques: Barycentric interpolation, Radial Basis Function, K-Nearest Neighbors and Inverse Blending optimization. Comparison metrics were designed to measure the performance across di⬚erent motion categories on criteria including smoothness, parametric error and computation time. We have implemented each method in our character animation platform {SmartBody} and we present several visualization renderings that provide a window for gleaning insights into the underlying pros and cons of each method in an intuitive way.},

Recently, large collections of motion capture data have been exploited for increased realism in avatar animation and control. Large motion sets have the advantage of accommodating a broad variety of natural human motion. However, when a motion set is large, the time required to identify an appropriate sequence of motions is the bottleneck for achieving interactive avatar control. In this paper, we present a novel method of precomputing avatar behavior from unlabeled motion data in order to animate and control avatars at minimal runtime cost. Based on dynamic programming, our method finds a control policy that indicates how the avatar should act in any given situation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through examples that include avatars interacting with each other and with the user. "

abstract = "Abstract A common issue in three-dimensional animation is the creation of contacts between a virtual creature and the environment. Contacts allow force exertion, which produces motion. This paper addresses the problem of computing contact configurations allowing to perform motion tasks such as getting up from a sofa, pushing an object or climbing. We propose a two-step method to generate contact configurations suitable for such tasks. The first step is an offline sampling of the range of motion (ROM) of a virtual creature. The \{ROM\} of the human arms and legs is precisely determined experimentally. The second step is a run time request confronting the samples with the current environment. The best contact configurations are then selected according to a heuristic for task efficiency. The heuristic is inspired by the force transmission ratio. Given a contact configuration, it measures the potential force that can be exerted in a given direction. The contact configurations are then used as inputs for an inverse kinematics solver that will compute the final animation. Our method is automatic and does not require examples or motion capture data. It is suitable for real time applications and applies to arbitrary creatures in arbitrary environments. Various scenarios (such as climbing, crawling, getting up, pushing or pulling objects) are used to demonstrate that our method enhances motion autonomy and interactivity in constrained environments.

The manipulator, based on the Stewart platform mechanism, consists mainly of two platforms and six linear actuators. The closed-form solution of the inverse kinematics is formulated in such a way as to optimize the computation efficiency of the iterative solution of the forward kinematics using the Newton-Raphson method. A modified Jacobian matrix which relates length velocities to Cartesian translational velocities and time rates of change of roll-pitch-yaw angles is introduced. Computer simulation is performed to evaluate the computation efficiency of the developed computation schemes},

REBA has been developed to fill a perceived need for a practitioner's field tool, specifically designed to be sensitive to the type of unpredictable working postures found in health care and other service industries. A team of ergonomists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and nurses collected and individually coded over 600 postural examples to produce a new tool incorporating dynamic and static postural loading factors, human-load interface (coupling), and a new concept of a gravity-assisted upper limb position. Initial reliability for inter-observer coding shows promise but further work is needed to establish the validity of the tool.},

Given a corpus of motion capture data, we automatically construct a directed graph called a motion graph that encapsulates connections among the database. The motion graph consists both of pieces of original motion and automatically generated transitions. Motion can be generated simply by building walks on the graph. We present a general framework for extracting particular graph walks that meet a user's specifications. We then show how this framework can be applied to the specific problem of generating different styles of locomotion along arbitrary paths.},

annote = {They construct a direct graph called motion graph that encapsulates connections among the database, containing original motions and automatically generated ones, which are the edges, and the nodes are choice points. It's also possible to add constrains to specify certain points along the path where the character must act in a specific way. They generate motion by piecing together example motions from the database. Move trees are a similar idea close to motion graphs, but created manually. To create transitions: identify portions of the initial clips that are similar → blending. To detect candidate transitions they measure the distance between two frames in terms of a point cloud driven by the skeleton → distance between frames. They create a error matrix between any two frames, and the local minima are the transition candidates. They set up a threshold. They apply lineal transformations and interpolate the joints to create transitions and blend. Problems: Sink and deadlocks are fixed using strong connected graphs. Artifacts due blending are fixed with constraint information. The user specifies a scalar function f(g,w) that evaluates the additional error accrued by appending an edge e to the existing path w, which my be the empty path ө → appends edges to create a graph The user also specifies a halt condition. Important observations: g should give sort of guidances and g shouldn't be too restrictive. Good points: Automatically constructed graphs that encapsulates connection among motions Bad points: The main bottleneck is locating the candidate transitions, O(Frames\^{}2) operations, though it's easy to parallelize. The transition threshold has to be specified by hand.},

Optimization is performed using a small set of simple goals, e.g., one hand should be on the ground or the center-of-mass should be above a particular height. These objectives are applied to short spacetime windows which can be composed to express goals over an entire animation. Specific contact locations needed to achieve objectives are not required by our method. We show that the method can synthesize many different kinds of movement, including walking, hand walking, breakdancing, flips, and crawling. Most of these movements have never been previously synthesized by physics-based methods.},

abstract = {We explore global randomized joint-space path planning for articulated robots that are subjected to task-space constraints. This paper describes a representation of constrained motion for joint-space planners and develops two simple and efficient methods for constrained sampling of joint configurations: tangent-space sampling (TS) and first-order retraction (FR). FR is formally proven to provide global sampling for linear task-space transformations. Constrained joint-space planning is important for many real-world problems, which involves redundant manipulators. On the one hand, tasks are designated in workspace coordinates: to rotate doors about fixed axes, to slide drawers along fixed trajectories, or to hold objects level during transport. On the other hand, joint-space planning gives alternative paths that use redundant degrees of freedom (DOFs) to avoid obstacles or satisfy additional goals while performing a task. We demonstrate that our methods are faster and more invariant to parameter choices than the techniques that exist.},

While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {The degrees of freedom problem is often posed by asking which of the many possible degrees of freedom does the nervous system control? By implication, other degrees of freedom are not controlled. We give an operational meaning to "controlled" and "uncontrolled" and describe a method of analysis through which hypotheses about controlled and uncontrolled degrees of freedom can be tested. In this conception, control refers to stabilization, so that lack of control implies reduced stability. The method was used to analyze an experiment on the sit-to-stand transition. By testing different hypotheses about the controlled variables, we systematically approximated the structure of control in joint space. We found that, for the task of sit-to-stand, the position of the center of mass in the sagittal plane was controlled. The horizontal head position and the position of the hand were controlled less stably, while vertical head position appears to be no more controlled than joint motions.},

The underlying control architecture of main and secondary behaviors (or tasks) is used to associate this new approach to other behaviors. We evaluate the use of these techniques for motion control and we present cascaded control as a way of hierarchically combining balance and other goal-oriented behaviors. The combined quality of providing realistic motions in real-time significantly improves the potential interaction with the human model in virtual reality applications and, more generally, enhances the posture and motion design process for complex articulated figures.

@article{Kuo2010,
abstract = {A healthy gait pattern depends on an array of biomechanical features, orchestrated by the central nervous system for economy and stability. Injuries and other pathologies can alter these features and result in substantial gait deficits, often with detrimental consequences for energy expenditure and balance. An understanding of the role of biomechanics in the generation of healthy gait, therefore, can provide insight into these deficits. This article examines the basic principles of gait from the standpoint of dynamic walking, an approach that combines an inverted pendulum model of the stance leg with a pendulum model of the swing leg and its impact with the ground. The heel-strike at the end of each step has dynamic effects that can contribute to a periodic gait and its passive stability. Biomechanics, therefore, can account for much of the gait pattern, with additional motor inputs that are important for improving economy and stability. The dynamic walking approach can predict the consequences of disruptions to normal biomechanics, and the associated observations can help explain some aspects of impaired gait. This article reviews the basic principles of dynamic walking and the associated experimental evidence for healthy gait and then considers how the principles may be applied to clinical gait pathologies.},

abstract = {RULA (rapid upper limb assessment) is a survey method developed for use in ergonomics investigations of workplaces where work-related upper limb disorders are reported. This tool requires no special equipment in providing a quick assessment of the postures of the neck, trunk and upper limbs along with muscle function and the external loads experienced by the body. A coding system is used to generate an action list which indicates the level of intervention required to reduce the risks of injury due to physical loading on the operator. It is of particular assistance in fulfilling the assessment requirements of both the European Community Directive (90/270/EEC) on the minimum safety and health requirements for work with display screen equipment and the UK Guidelines on the prevention of work-related upper limb disorders.},

@article{Jacquier-Bret2012,
abstract = {In this work, it is proposed to evaluate the upper-limb movements through a global index of performance borrowed from the field of robotics: the manipulability. For a given posture, this index quantifies the set of velocities that can be achieved at the wrist in all the Cartesian directions. The manipulability can be represented by an ellipsoid from which the volume and shape related parameters can be derived. During a reach to grasp movement, the ellipsoid obtained from experiment presented a flattened shape along the forearm longitudinal axis and an increased volume as the arm was extended. From this study, it is concluded that: (1) the ellipsoid volume reflects well the ability to generate speed at the wrist which is effectively maximal for an extended posture; (2) if maximal velocity is an important parameter it might be advisable to primarily move the hand perpendicularly to the forearm longitudinal axis. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: The interest of manipulability indices is that they evaluate globally a posture of the upper-limb in relation to a given task. This original parameter could help to design environments or devices in order that the adopted postures maximise one particular aspect of the performance, i.e. the velocity of the hand.},
