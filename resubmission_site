Hollerbach

We tackle the multi contact locomotion problem, of growing interest in the humanoid robotics community.
Our contribution is an accurate approximation of the feasible space of the problem, of high dimension and impossible to sample,
with a low dimensional space. This complexity reduction results in a dramatic improvement
of our algorithm's performance regarding previous work. Indeed, our framework is the first to demonstrate
interactive performance on the real robot, allowing to consider online planning applications.
